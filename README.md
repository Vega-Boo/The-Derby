# The-Derby

This is an arcade-style horse racing game I made for my year 1 HND Games Development Course at Edinburgh College,  inspired by Konami's Track and Field. 

The player competes in 3 increasingly difficult races against other jockeys. On the track are fences that the player needs to jump or else they slow down if they hit them. The player must place 3rd or higher in the first race to qualify. on the 2nd race, 2nd or higher. The player must place first in the last race to win the cup.

Included in the game is a how-to-play section.
